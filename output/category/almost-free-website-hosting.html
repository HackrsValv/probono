</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hi! So let's start from the Pro Bono Page hosting itself. It's hosting is almost free and you can do it for less.</p>
<p>There are many services in the Internet, that are giving some starting packages that are either very cheap or free and here I am using two of them: </p>
<p>* Cloudflare
* GitHub</p>
<p>To generate the site I am using:</p>
<p>* Pelican - a static web site generator. Basically you create pages in MarkDown and it generates static HTML files - so any hosting, even the cheapest one, shared hosting can host the site and it is very fast, small, easy to backup/restore/move. Static site generators are great! There are many of them - I have chosen Pelican because I know a bit of Python and also it looked like it did not require lots of work to use. If you need very powerful one - check Hugo.</p>
<p>the costs are: </p>
<p>* Domain name (in my case - this is a subdomain, probono that is part of hackrsvalv.com - so I don't pay extra for that). Usually I buy domain names via GKG.NET, but recently started to use Cloudflare for convenience. It is not the wises solution though as I am putting all eggs in one basket (i.e. if Cloudflare would boot me out or would be having issues - managing of the domain might be problematic), but I accept the risks.
* I pay for GitHub subscription, but you do not have to. The setup does not require paid GitHub service. Also you can use any Git provider you want or do not use it at all and keep everything on your computer (make sure you have good backups).</p>                </article>

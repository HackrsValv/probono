Hi and welcome! From time to time I am asked to host or setup sites/servers or systems and I am doing it pro bono. Sometimes I receive small gifts or donations for that, that I drink or eat :) Most of the time I take of servers, hosting, deployment, other times - the server might be rented and I am just helping to administer it. There are few services, occasions, where I pay for everything from my pocket.

To host a site or a bigger service, especially if you want it to be performant, highly available takes time and money, so I am always looking to optimize the money part. I have some time and enjoy what I am doing - also it is a great opportunity to learn. 

In this corner of the internet I would like to share with you on how I run services for small price, why I am choosing this way or another and if is there a free cheese. I would love to receive feedback, questions, comments and if you need help to run some small site of yours - let me know. You can reach me via [email](mailto:martynas@hackrsvalv.com).
